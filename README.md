# Welcome to Cortex ðŸ§ 

Cortex is dedicated to building **Cortex Agent**, the premier AI-powered dashboard for managing and interacting with the Solana blockchain. Using cutting-edge AI agents, Cortex simplifies complex blockchain tasks, providing unparalleled insights and automation for traders, developers, and enthusiasts.

Weâ€™re proud to be the **first platform to leverage DeepSeek R1**, a blockchain-specific AI framework designed to integrate seamlessly with Solanaâ€™s high-speed, low-latency infrastructure. While we are not open-source yet as we continue beta testing and refining our platform, our mission remains clear: to redefine how users engage with Solana.

## Why Weâ€™re Not Open-Source Yet

Cortex is a new and ambitious platform, powered by the cutting-edge **DeepSeek R1** framework. While we believe in the value of open-source collaboration, weâ€™re currently in a deliberate beta-testing phase to ensure the platform meets the highest standards. During this time, weâ€™re:
- **Beta-Testing**: Refining the platform through real-world use cases with early adopters.
- **Gathering User Insights**: Tailoring Cortex based on user feedback to better serve the Solana community.
- **Building a Strong Foundation**: Ensuring that Cortex is secure, robust, and scalable before opening the codebase.

Once the platform is thoroughly tested and optimized, we plan to release it as open-source, enabling collaboration and customization for developers worldwide.

## Whatâ€™s Next for Cortex

Weâ€™re committed to continuous innovation and improvement. Our future plans include:
- **Open-Source Release**: Unlocking collaboration opportunities for developers across the globe.
- **Enhanced AI Models**: Ongoing updates to DeepSeek R1 for even greater performance and accuracy.
- **Integration Expansion**: Adding support for more Solana-based platforms and dApps.
- **Community-Driven Development**: Partnering with users to refine and expand features based on real-world feedback.
